[10:55:41	][IC] Johnny Vort: It should be fine, the only issue I can see is if they craft another collar.
[10:55:50	][IC] Johnny Vort: You can make fake collars.
[10:56:07	][IC] sususu: Each vort will be allowed to only have one, because we have limitations.

[10:57:00	][IC] sususu: It'll have to suffice.
