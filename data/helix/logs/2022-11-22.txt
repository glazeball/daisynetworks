[03:17:30	][OOC] Frank Mazzarelli: right now 'industrial zone' but i think it should be a condemned zone

[03:17:45	][OOC] Frank Mazzarelli: loyalists lol
[03:17:46	][OOC] C24:RL.GRID-5: to me it looks kind of like a quarantine zone
[03:17:57	][OOC] C24:RL.GRID-5: cuz its so close to the infested area
[03:18:02	][OOC] Frank Mazzarelli: yeah but the shitty exterior is deceptive because the rooms are really nice

[03:21:18	][IC] C24:RL.GRID-5: <:: Feel like they would make nice apartments. ::>
[03:21:21	][IC] Frank Mazzarelli: Because we need to find ways to block off parts of the map to limit everyone spreading out. We'll be here a long time so we have plenty of time to make events opening more spots up.
[03:21:44	][IC] Frank Mazzarelli: Thats why i made a few shops closed/rubbled.
