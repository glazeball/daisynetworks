[04:46:06	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: Fake collars in theory should still have digits.
[04:46:12	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: So you could get cohesion points.
[04:46:18	][IC] Randy Cole: <:: Becuase I know it shows your ID when you get freed. ::>
[04:46:23	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: But pasta threatened to randomly check collars and I dont trust him.

[04:47:28	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: Well they have yet to decide.
[04:47:38	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: If they choose i17 v3 it will have shell beach + huge outalnds.
[04:47:48	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: But outlands has an OTA base so theyll probably patrol it occasionally.
[04:47:50	][IC] Randy Cole: <:: Yeah I think my character would be in the outlands most of the time. ::>
[04:48:04	][IC] Randy Cole: <:: But they said it they didn't want that place to be a rebel hub. ::>
[04:48:09	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: Tbh i wouldn't mind if outlands was patrolled by OTA commonly but had good loot.
[04:48:15	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: So you dont circle jerk away from the rest of the map.
[04:48:17	][IC] Randy Cole: <:: Yeah. ::>
[04:48:30	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: And shell beach + sewers was real rebel territory.
[04:48:30	][IC] Randy Cole: <:: Get really geared then fight some OTA. ::>
[04:48:34	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: Would be based.
[04:48:37	][IC] Randy Cole: <:: Yeah. ::>

[04:48:51	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: Unironically hitting OTA patrols in the outlands would be so bad ass.
[04:48:53	][IC] Randy Cole: <:: So OTA would be jacked for no fucking reason. ::>
[04:48:57	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: Theyd patrol around for a week thinking theyre hot shit.
[04:49:02	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: And then get hit and we get like AR2s.
[04:49:09	][IC] Mar'Eyoo: And despite them losing nothing besides their dignity.
