[18:01:41	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: I wonder if we're gonna get fake shackles with fake IDs.
[18:01:53	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Cause then vorts can just be untracable.

[18:06:08	][IC] Sho'Tcop: Okay so.
[18:06:29	][IC] Sho'Tcop: Maybe we should say inner city combat cannot happen with vorts unless they are forced to.
[18:06:53	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Tbh I think we should just hold free vorts to a HIGH standard.
[18:07:05	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: 'Just because it is mechanically possible doesn't mean you should do it'.
[18:07:08	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Like abusing AOE.
[18:07:13	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: That's just distasteful.
[18:07:20	][IC] Sho'Tcop: I figured that out when we allowed DOG to be a freed vort.
[18:07:29	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: I understand AOE from a perspective the aiming the beam is aids.
[18:07:38	][IC] Sho'Tcop: I myself.

[18:08:35	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Guh.
[18:09:00	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Istg we hold OTA to a decently high standard aswell (They keep dissapointing us with their mentality tho).
[18:09:08	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: If vorts become THIS powerful.
[18:09:15	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Then they too need to be god tier roleplayers.
[18:09:37	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: I wish vorts had the standing of 'Strong respectful aliens'.
[18:09:38	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: And not.
[18:09:45	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: 'Elite shotcoppers'.
[18:10:27	][IC] Sho'Tcop: We can definitely do that if denuke understands this.
[18:10:34	][IC] Sho'Tcop: He can be very leniant.
[18:10:54	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Well.
[18:11:01	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Today I am going to fuck up some vortigaunts anyways.

[18:11:11	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: If it goes the way I predict it goes.
[18:11:14	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: I'll forever hate vorts.
[18:11:16	][IC] Sho'Tcop: I am going to metagame this and not log on to my vort.
[18:11:18	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: And become OTA main again.
[18:11:29	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Nah it is quite tame.

[18:12:22	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Nobody told me wardens know IC.
[18:12:28	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: So for all we know at HQ, he's still running around.
[18:12:50	][IC] Sho'Tcop: I literally gave the body to wallman and pathfinder lol.
[18:12:59	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Fucking Cengiz.
[18:13:03	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Pathfinder ain't a warden.
[18:13:06	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: And wallman is a fucking meme.
[18:13:34	][IC] Sho'Tcop: Literally about 30 mins after that bunker raid, me and a couple of other vorts killed him for being a savage, and took his body back as a peace offering.
[18:13:35	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Wekk, IC is IC. We'll figure it out that he's already dead when we get there.
[18:13:41	][LOOC] LORD-STEVEN-X: I know I watched le streem
[18:14:04	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Anyways, we want those vorts as captives and get them to do some forced labour for us.
[18:14:13	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: I was talked out of killing them.
[18:14:24	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Which we totally should've but admin faction vs players.
[18:14:27	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Regardless.
[18:14:33	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: We're sending in a warden squad.
[18:14:48	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: And basically going to 'ask' any vort about the location of those three.
[18:14:52	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: If they co-operate, no issue.
[18:15:00	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: If they don't we'll probably rough them up.
[18:15:03	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: If they start shooting.
[18:15:06	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: We start blasting aswelll.
[18:15:08	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Very simple.
[18:15:18	][IC] Sho'Tcop: Tell me oocly if any of them just straight up snitch btw.
[18:15:25	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: LOL.
[18:15:35	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Regardless.
[18:15:45	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Depending on the Vort player.
[18:15:48	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: THis can go badly.
[18:16:02	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: I'll make sure to tell the warden ppl to "not shoot unless vorts are CLEARLY" hostile.
[18:16:20	][IC] Sho'Tcop: Well, lord beckett was pked, so thats one chance of catastrophy out the windowe.
[18:16:25	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Who the fuck was even the 3rd vort besides dog and alfie.
[18:16:35	][IC] Sho'Tcop: Dog, alfie and burgerwithonion.
[18:16:42	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Ok I don't know the 3rd guy.
[18:16:46	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: So that'll all go well.
[18:16:49	][IC] LORD-STEVEN-X: Alfie is a uhhh.
[18:17:06	][IC] Sho'Tcop: Third guy didn't even engage in any sort of fight, kinda sat in the corner.
