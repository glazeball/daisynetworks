[21:34:58	][OOC] test char: yes here watch
[21:34:59	][OOC] galunga: nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[21:35:02	][OOC] test char: also one last thing
[21:35:06	][OOC] test char: for some reason atm
[21:35:18	][OOC] test char: the hangup part of the code isnt working right so i need to make it hang up both sides
[21:35:23	][OOC] test char: when you hang up the other person can still talk to u
[21:35:28	][OOC] test char: but u cant talk back
[21:35:28	][OOC] galunga: oh lol
[21:35:43	][OOC] galunga: this has some great potential though
[21:35:43	][OOC] test char: its all very complicated.... :skull:
[21:35:49	][OOC] galunga: this could
[21:35:59	][OOC] galunga: in theory completely remove the need for radios in civilian RP
[21:36:03	][OOC] galunga: it has huge potential impact
[21:36:06	][OOC] test char: would like to add speaker phone option too but again, complex
[21:36:28	][OOC] test char: cuz then id have to add a bunch more listeners and things. the code is sorta set up to support it but.. it needs to be refactored anyways. UGH
[21:36:38	][OOC] galunga: oh yes is it 1-1 atm
[21:36:43	][OOC] galunga: so nobody else can hear
[21:36:55	][OOC] test char: technically there is no way to do confrence calls or speakerphone
[21:36:58	][OOC] test char: currently
[21:37:10	][OOC] galunga: hmm ok then that might prove difficult to replace the radio if its only 1-1
[21:37:15	][OOC] test char: thatd need more complex ui interactions and a lot more code to do but it *can* be done ofc
[21:37:35	][OOC] galunga: well it has huge potential nonetheless
[21:37:42	][OOC] galunga: secretary could be more important as a result
[21:37:47	][OOC] test char: tyty. connector almost ready too
[21:37:57	][OOC] test char: all part of the summer update <3
