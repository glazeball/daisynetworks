[21:34:13	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I've seen SO many.
[21:34:15	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: And someone had like 4 in storage for a year.
[21:34:21	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Perhaps more.
[21:34:24	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Bro.
[21:34:31	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: One character had his own armoury.
[21:34:38	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Fucking insane.
[21:34:48	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I remember on Lawrence I came to the BMDs with like 3k chips and i was like "wow im pretty rich".
[21:34:56	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And someone was talking about how they had 40k.
[21:35:00	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Had me like.
[21:35:01	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Lmao.

[21:35:11	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Do you remember Path before she was a BMD?
[21:35:14	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Nah.
[21:35:16	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Lawrence was new.
[21:35:24	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And if I did on another character, i forgot.
[21:35:34	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Lawrence was a good rebel though, I had a lot planned for him.
[21:35:38	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: He hunted xen creatures.
[21:35:51	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Wanted to get into CT and use him as a quest giver.
[21:35:52	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: She had about 8K chips and a SMG. I never shot coped once and played for three months. Loved it.
[21:36:04	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: People rely on shooting to get their fun.
[21:36:15	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Too much so now.
[21:36:20	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Eh...
[21:36:24	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I mean.. What else can rebels do.
[21:36:28	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: RP.
[21:36:32	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Thats what I did.
[21:36:36	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Most rebelRP is a circlejerk.. You can not lie.
[21:36:38	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I gathered intel.
[21:36:45	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: People hate RPing with people outside of their circle as rebels.
[21:36:48	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I never circle jerked.
[21:36:53	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Not you.
[21:36:55	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: People like..
[21:36:58	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Whoever plays Aeric.
[21:37:04	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Remeber Hox?
[21:37:07	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: On Lawrence, I RP'd with him daily.
[21:37:08	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Hox?
[21:37:09	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: No.
[21:37:13	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Hoxworth.
[21:37:15	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Nope.
[21:37:19	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I didn't know many names.
[21:37:20	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: When I first started.
[21:37:31	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I RP'd with him as Path (Normal char back then).
[21:37:46	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I didnt devote to the norm of rebel RP as it is now.
[21:37:51	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I went places.
[21:37:54	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Done shifts.
[21:37:57	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Me too, at least I tried.
[21:37:58	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Gained a tier.
[21:38:02	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Got to three.
[21:38:08	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Got reprimanded for it.
[21:38:13	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: We need more rebels like that, I can't lie.
[21:38:16	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: When caught in the slums.
[21:38:37	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: As it stands, most T4+ are actual loyalists.
[21:38:39	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: My char got interogated.
[21:38:43	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Almost died.
[21:38:45	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: She didnt.
[21:38:55	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: And was then religated out of the slums for good.
[21:39:02	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Otherwise they would have killed her.
[21:39:05	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: The CP's.
[21:39:15	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Damn.
[21:39:16	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Three months I played an undercover Rebel.
[21:39:21	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Pathfinder lore right here.
[21:39:21	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Fucking hard lmao.
[21:39:26	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Aye a lot of it.
[21:39:31	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I dunno man.
[21:39:34	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I wanna try rebelRP again.
[21:39:40	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I've done a little on the rat king char.
[21:39:52	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: But I'm too afraid to venture back into the streets.
[21:40:02	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: People just wanna "get gun, shoot cop".
[21:40:02	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And when I try to find people in the underground slum area.
[21:40:07	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Nobody is there.
[21:40:18	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I've gone on my rebel 3 times this week, looking for people to RP with.
[21:40:22	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: We can agree PF is an arse right?
[21:40:31	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I dont know her well enough.
[21:40:34	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Damn lol.
[21:40:40	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Only interactions with pf have been bmd.
[21:40:45	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Actually scratch that.
[21:40:50	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: You did save me once on Lawrence.
[21:41:01	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: There was a lot of zombies.
[21:41:06	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And you came down the ladder.
[21:41:07	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Shot them.
[21:41:09	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Then disappeared.
[21:41:13	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: LOL.
[21:41:20	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Sounds about right.
[21:41:24	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Only way that char didn't die there and then was because of that.
[21:41:29	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I brought a pistol but ran out of ammo.

[21:41:43	]Walter Hartwell White has critically hit npc_vj_hlr1_boid dealing 39 damage (CritChance was 0.74).
[21:41:56	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: We need a reduction in guns in V3.
[21:42:01	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Aye we do.
[21:42:01	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Emphasize RP.
[21:42:07	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Make it like TnB.
[21:42:10	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: You never see guns on TnB.
[21:42:14	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Wanna know smth?
[21:42:14	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Until you do.
[21:42:16	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Sure.
[21:42:30	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I havent shot cop once, as a normal character, since I joined WN.
[21:42:38	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Me either.
[21:42:45	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Well.. Except for the time the cops were in the metros.
[21:42:52	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: On V4.
[21:42:57	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I only did it to survive though.
[21:42:59	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Didn't seek them.
[21:43:08	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: So I guess that doesn't count as shotcopping?
[21:43:12	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Or it does. I dunno.
[21:43:17	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Aye perhaps.
[21:43:22	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I did as event chars.
[21:43:26	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: But mostly S2M.
[21:43:40	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I havent PK'd anyone with a gun.
[21:43:41	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I get the excitement of wanting to shotcop.
[21:43:44	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: *However*.
[21:43:56	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I have had people killed indirectly.
[21:44:09	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Correlation to you something?
[21:44:11	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Or *.
[21:44:20	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Or you sent people to kill people.
[21:44:29	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Out of the two, who has had more kills do you think. Jen or Path?
[21:44:38	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Oh definitely Jen.
[21:44:40	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Lmao.
[21:44:44	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I think loyalists cause more death.
[21:44:50	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Thats how they climb the corporate ladder.
[21:44:55	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I didnt even plan to on any of them.
[21:45:05	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Here is a good story.
[21:45:13	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Someone brought me a drug.
[21:45:18	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I was a sr doc.
[21:45:18	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Real.
[21:45:27	]Walter Hartwell White has gained level 1 in the Guns skill.
[21:45:28	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: It had a - Wait no I wasnt.
[21:45:32	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I was Director.
[21:45:38	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: You've been director forever.
[21:45:43	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: It had a label denoting death on consumption.
[21:45:49	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: They got found.
[21:45:56	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Then killed for giving it to me lmao.
[21:46:00	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Damn.
[21:46:10	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I guess that wasn't really your fault though.
[21:46:14	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Can't really pin that on Jen.
[21:46:16	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Nah not really.
[21:46:24	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I was also Director for 10 months.
[21:46:28	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Damn.
[21:46:31	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: So not bad going.
[21:46:37	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: You know what surprises me.
[21:46:42	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Theres not more corruption in CMRU.
[21:46:53	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: People purposefully having surgeries or something go wrong.
[21:46:59	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Aye true.
[21:47:09	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: No one likes being PK'd to Med RP.
[21:47:14	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I suppose.
[21:47:21	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: But like, when Jen had her throat sliced.
[21:47:28	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: At the first DA debate.
[21:47:32	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: The char who done it was a throwaway.
[21:47:36	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: No not that.
[21:47:38	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Made hours prior.
[21:47:40	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Oh.
[21:47:45	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: It surprised me that nobody that did the medRP.
[21:47:50	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Tried to like.. Not help.
[21:47:56	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: OH i see.
[21:48:05	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Thats down to the characters.
[21:48:07	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Like, as much as I don't want to say it.
[21:48:14	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Lets say I was Director of CMRU.
[21:48:16	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: As Ulysses.
[21:48:23	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And I saw Jen getting beat to death or something.
[21:48:27	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Idk, something horridic.
[21:48:34	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I don't think Ulysses would try to stop it.
[21:48:39	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Unless there would be publicity.
[21:48:41	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: LOL.
[21:48:51	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Yh I see what you mean by corrupt.
[21:48:53	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Because think of it this way, from his point of view.
[21:49:00	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: You die, he MAYBE gets promoted.
[21:49:07	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: You live, he saved you, he's the district hero.
[21:49:19	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Thats how I think when I play Ulysses.
[21:49:26	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: His character is all about gaining power.
[21:49:34	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: That was why I created him originally.
[21:49:41	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: He was gonna be some activist.
[21:49:53	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Damn you taking all the fun out of it now lol.
[21:49:57	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: With an ideology called "Nathism".
[21:50:01	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: What do you mean.
[21:50:05	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I like what I do, its weird, i dunno.
[21:50:07	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Dw lol.
[21:50:19	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I have big asperations for Ulysses.
[21:50:22	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Being staff I see a lot and have to RP as though I havent.
[21:50:32	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Yeah, thats one thing.
[21:50:42	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: See I want to be CT one day, yeah?
[21:50:50	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: But one thing I fear, because I have lapses in judgement.
[21:50:54	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Is that I'll learn something while GMing.
[21:51:10	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And just, entirely accidentally, say something icly.
[21:51:18	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Been there and done that myself.
[21:51:23	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Like I'll learn a guys name while GMing, and accidentally say it while on a char.
[21:51:24	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I fear that.
[21:51:28	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: It happens.
[21:51:32	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: From time to time.
[21:51:49	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Yeah but I've been banned for metagame before, I don't want to do it again, even if on accident.
[21:52:03	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Which is why I'm both wanting to be CT, but also drawn away to avoid things like that.
[21:52:19	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: It all comes down to me I suppose.
[21:52:23	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Best advice I can give is this.
[21:53:19	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Pick a side for your main character. Then all other event chars can be for the other. Its how I done it, and then on my main, Jen, I react to whats ahead of me, rather than whats happened already. If I see it in the legimate way, I then react.
[21:53:36	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I suppose, yeah.
[21:53:40	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Ulysses is my main character.
[21:53:56	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: But if I get my vort app accepted, it might split 50/50.
[21:54:04	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Bad thing about that, the Vort I want to play is also a loyalist.
[21:54:09	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Nice.
[21:54:17	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Which means I'd have to keep up 2 loyalist lives.
[21:54:23	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: 1, Ulysses, who seeks power.
[21:54:31	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: 2, the Vort, who wants to be a chef.
[21:54:41	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Another thing is this.
[21:55:12	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Just remember whats needed on your mains, then on event chars if you forget smth, just claim ignorance icly and state "Who the fuck are you again?" lol.
[21:55:22	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Real.
[21:55:38	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Its just a juggling act tbf.
[21:55:45	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Takes time to get used to it all.
[21:55:50	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I guess it would.
[21:56:01	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I was explaining to someone today about my chars.
[21:56:04	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: If I had an event char though, I know exactly who he'd be.
[21:56:25	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: His name would be César Ortiz.
[21:56:34	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And he'd give quests to find and hunt xen creatures.
[21:56:34	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I had CMRU lead, I have BMD co lead, IMS event, and server council.
[21:56:42	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Whats an IMS.
[21:56:52	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Erm....One sec forgot.
[21:56:57	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Gorp.
[21:57:01	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Institure of medical sciences.
[21:57:05	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: What.
[21:57:07	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Institute.
[21:57:08	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Whats the difference.
[21:57:19	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: IMS vs CMRU.
[21:57:28	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: So the IMS is a SUmmit faction, same as CPRD. They sit above the Ministry and CMRU.
[21:57:33	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Ohhh.
[21:57:41	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I forgot about CPRD ngl.
[21:57:42	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: They sit above the VA and CA as well.
[21:57:46	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: They kinda dont exist anymore.
[21:57:51	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Havent seen them in ages.
[21:58:00	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Yh they havent been around in a while.
[21:58:09	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: How close is D11 to the Summit.
[21:58:32	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Pretty much on its door step, like one district away from it.
[21:58:51	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Bro.
[21:58:57	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Then this is the time to bring back CPRD.
[21:59:00	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: If we're that close.
[21:59:05	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: IMS are back.
[21:59:09	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Real.
[21:59:10	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: *Nemethova*.
[21:59:19	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I just realized.
[21:59:23	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: The World Map has to be changed.
[21:59:27	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Yh.
[21:59:28	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Now that Heartwick is gone.
[21:59:39	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Aye it gets updated.
[21:59:52	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I think it still says noodle is ca.
[21:59:59	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Might do.
[22:00:06	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Our lore guy is LOA atm.
[22:00:12	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Whos the lore guy.
[22:00:18	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Robert.
[22:00:22	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: He's LOA?
[22:00:27	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I swear I saw him talking in discord like.
[22:00:28	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Semi LoA.
[22:00:29	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: 3 days ago.
[22:00:41	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Nevermind it was 2 weeks ago.
[22:01:01	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Remind me real quick.
[22:01:07	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Robert, is he asian?
[22:01:12	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I swear I remember hearing him talk.
[22:01:18	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Idk lol. Dont think he is.
[22:01:22	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Maybe not.
[22:01:35	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Maybe it was a different robert.
[22:01:41	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Might have been.
[22:01:43	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: There was a dude who used to play impulse.
[22:01:46	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Who came to willard.
[22:01:48	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Named Robert.
[22:01:53	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: And he was asian.
[22:01:56	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Not sure tbf.
[22:02:06	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I know Robert is English.
[22:02:10	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Maybe thats it.
[22:02:11	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I dunno.
[22:02:27	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Hey by the way, since you're Server Council, if you can share, why did Grass man get community banned.
[22:02:42	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I cant share that.
[22:02:46	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Fairs fair.
[22:03:01	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: I just found it shocking, didn't think he would do something that bad.
[22:03:09	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Aye me neither.
[22:03:10	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Remember RPing with him when he owned the italian restraunt.
[22:03:17	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: He was a good RPer.
[22:03:22	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Shame really.
[22:03:28	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Suppose it is.

[22:04:07	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: Client issue.
[22:04:09	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: Maybe.
[22:04:11	][IC] Jenifer Maesroe: I cannot seee through it.
[22:04:15	][IC] Walter Hartwell White: This map's always been weird for me.
