[21:05:53	][IC] teasasdasad: I've seen them yeah.
[21:06:02	][IC] teasasdasad: Apparently wanted to make them that can do them in-game than the manual way.
[21:06:50	][IC] vortivort: Its going to be something similar but for character creation and other specific events. It's still going to be hard-coded because it needs some really accurate stuff that is very hard to be correctly done in simple editors so yep.
[21:07:15	][IC] vortivort: Also me and legaz working on scene plugin that have in-game editor!!
[21:07:40	][IC] vortivort: With its own cursed stuff like blender dope sheet.
[21:07:49	][IC] vortivort: If you ever used blender!!

[21:08:50	][IC] vortivort: Not the ones with obunga.png.
[21:09:05	][IC] teasasdasad: Yeah I remember there was some talks about making a nextbot base for Willard for instance.
[21:09:22	][IC] teasasdasad: As would be really handy to replace the current systems and not be as reliant on the maps themselves then either.
[21:09:43	][IC] vortivort: Its for the same sw local game session actually but can be implemented for willard too!!!!!!
[21:10:12	][IC] teasasdasad: Looking forward to see that, just heard that many of the existing ones struggle with performance or have other issues in general.
[21:10:25	][IC] teasasdasad: It's generally hard to find anything proper with nextbots due to the mems.
[21:10:42	][IC] vortivort: There's literally two usable bases on the entire workshop.
[21:10:46	][IC] vortivort: Drg and iv04.
[21:11:08	][IC] teasasdasad: That pretty much explains it then that forced to use one or the other.
