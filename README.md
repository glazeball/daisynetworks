I (amazydaisy) am deeply autistic and speak in a muted, nasally voice in a desperate attempt to seem feminine when I engage with others online. Online, I'm a pretty princess who doesn't have to worry about anything, but every time I get up from my computer or look into my mirror without a phone in my hand the reality of my life begins to sink in and I have a mini panic attack. Also I like diaper play and discord grooming
This gamemode is almost the exact same as Willard Networks open source gamemode, but with a few tweaks to add trans visibility to it <3

If anyone has any suggestions, let me know. 

Thanks!
